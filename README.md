# Data

All data is read from JSON files located in `/src/assets/data/`. The below diagram shows the structure of this data.

In the JSON files references between objects are stored as 10-length [nanoids](https://github.com/ai/nanoid). For example, the reference `"spirit": "1234567890"` in JSON is resolved by looking up the spirit with `"guid": "1234567890"`.

![Data structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silverfeelin/SkyGame-Planner/master/diagrams/SkyPlannerData.jpg)

For those who know what they're doing the data is available through the `skyData` object in the console. The helpers [`CostHelper`](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/SkyGame-Planner/blob/master/src/app/helpers/cost-helper.ts), [`DateHelper`](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/SkyGame-Planner/blob/master/src/app/helpers/date-helper.ts) and [`NodeHelper`](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/SkyGame-Planner/blob/master/src/app/helpers/node-helper.ts) are also available.

This allows you to do cool things with your own code, like measuring how much of each in-game currency you've spent on items:

```js
// Select all items unlocked through spirit trees.
var unlockedItems = skyData.itemConfig.items.filter(item => item.unlocked && item.nodes?.length);
// Select the unlocked nodes from these items.
var unlockedNodes = unlockedItems.map(item => item.nodes.filter(n => n.unlocked)).flat();
// Add up the currencies spent on these nodes.
var spent = CostHelper.add(CostHelper.create(), ...unlockedNodes);
// Log the results.
console.log('Spent currencies on items:', spent)
// > Spent currencies on items: {ac: 1, c: 18, ec: 0, h: 8, sc: 0, sh: 0}

// Select all bought IAPs
const spentIap = skyData.iapConfig.items.filter(a => a.bought).reduce((a,v) => a+v.price, 0);
console.log('Spent (USD) on IAP:', spentIap.toFixed(2));
// > Spent (USD) on IAP: 29.99
```
