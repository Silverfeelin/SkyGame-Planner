The spritesheet files (icons_#.png) have been automatically generated by a script.
These files contain icons sourced from the Sky: Children of the Light Wiki
(https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/), which are often manually created by wiki contributors.

Permission to host these files, in order to optimize the delivery of icons, has been granted to the Sky Planner by the
Bureaucrats of the wiki, on the condition that appropriate credit is attributed to the wiki. The Sky Planner website
acknowledges the wiki contributions in both the website footer and the Info page.

All icon sources are found in the accompanying icons.json file.
